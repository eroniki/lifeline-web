## About Us
Since the end of 2008, Lifeline Ambulance Service, Inc. has ceased operations and is no longer responding to medical emergency requests.

While we are proud of the years of service we provided, we have now closed our business. We extend our deepest gratitude to our patients, families, and partners for their trust and support throughout our years of operation.
